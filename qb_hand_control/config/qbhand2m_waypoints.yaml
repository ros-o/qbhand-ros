# Waypoints describe the desired motion trajectory:
#  - time [s]: can be either a single value or an interval for which joint_positions hold
#  - joint_positions:
#     - first synergy hand closure [0,1];
#     - thumb-little manipulation offset [-1,1];
#  - joint_velocities: optional, use it only if you want a nonzero value
#     - first synergy hand closure [0,1]/s;
#     - thumb-little manipulation offset [-1,1]/s;
#  - joint_accelerations: optional, use it only if you want a nonzero value
#     - first synergy hand closure [0,1]/s^2;
#     - thumb-little manipulation offset [-1,1]/s^2;
#
# It is worth noting that, if specified, joint_positions, joint_velocities and joint_accelerations must be of size two.
